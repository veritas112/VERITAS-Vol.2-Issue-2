                                                         THE PRINCIPAL



























    Forensic science comprises a diverse array of disciplines, from fingerprint and

    DNA analysis to anthropology and wildlife forensics. Though they represent var-
    ied disciplines, all forensic scientists face a common set of challenges. The rise

    of Artificial Intelligence, mass production, cloud computing and encrypted net-
    working tools have challenged the forensic science community like never before.



    The Department of Forensic Science at Kristu Jayanti College (Autono-
    mous), Bengaluru runs a Bachelor’s (single major) and Master’s in Science

    in Forensic Science programmes. During the coming academic year, the de-
    partment will also initiate a Bachelor dual major programme in the disci-

    plines of biotechnology and forensic science. The department has made mas-
    sive leaps in providing knowledge and training in the past 4 years and has
    excelled in the quality of education provided to the students of the department.



    The  Forensic Science newsletter, ‘Veritas’ is  a bi-annual  newsletter  pub-

    lished by the department of forensic science which compiles articles writ-
    ten by the forensic science students. The previous issues of Veritas have
    set a  high  standard with respect to content, design  and quality. The  editori-

    al board of the newsletter comprised of teachers and students have worked hard
    to provide a rich and effective reading experience to the readers in each issue.



    This issue touches on topics of Artificial Intelligence, self-driving cars and many

    more. On this occasion, I congratulate the department of Forensic Science and the
    editorial board of Veritas for the effective contents and design of the issue.

    The interesting field of Forensic Science comes with its challenges. The evolution of

    criminals’ minds to commit crimes to circumvent the investigation protocols already
    available makes this field both interesting and challenging. Some of the challenges

    faced by forensic investigators needs brainstorming, combined deliberations and ac-
    cess to current knowledge of science.



    The forensic science newsletter, Veritas published by the department of forensic sci-

    ence, Kristu Jayanti College is unique and focussed in bringing out the requirements
    of forensic investigators. Each issue of the newsletter combines works by many stu-

    dents of the department in multiple fields of forensic science and craftily edited and
    designed to please the eye.




    Previous issues of Veritas have been on the top of the choice for readers. I am sure,
    this issue too will evoke positive impact on the readers.

    I congratulate the editorial team of Veritas and the department of forensic science
    for bringing out  this issue of the newsletter and wish the readers an insightful and

    enriching journey as they read this issue of Veritas.

        THE 74th INDIAN REPUBLIC DAY


            From the Editors
            This second issue of the second volume of Veritas, the bi-an-

            nual forensic science newsletter of the Department of Forensic

            Science at Kristu Jayanti College, Autonomous, Bangalore, is

            a special edition memorializing the 74th Indian Republic Day.

            26 January 1950 marks one of the most historical moments of

            the Indian nation when the Indian constitution came into force

            and declared Purna Swaraj or complete independence for India.
            The contemplations and deliberations of several virtuous indi-

            viduals, including Dr. B. R. Ambedkar, B N Rau, K.M.Munshi,

            Muhammed Saadulah, Alladi Krishnaswamy Iyer, Gopala Swa-

            mi Ayyangar, N. Madhava Rao, and T. T. Krishnamachari gave

            birth to the world’s longest written constitution. The constitu-

            tion drafted by the drafting committee was signed by the 284

            members of the constitutional assembly at the Constitution Hall
            in New Delhi on 24 January 1950.

            in 1946 to its effective enforcement in 1950 with 395 articles, 8

            schedules, and 22 parts, the Indian constitution took a total of 2

            years, 11 months, and 18 days to take form. Presently, the Indian

            constitution comprises 448 articles, 12 schedules, and 25 parts.

            The words sovereign, socialist, secular, democratic, and republic

            highlighted in the Preamble of the Indian constitution defines how

            India broke its slavery to foreign rule, thus attaining autonomy.
            The constitution, while providing ample rights to protect its peo-

            ple, also advocates the responsibilities of the people in protecting

            the nation in all the different domains. The Indian Republic day is

            celebrated with great pride, with people from all across the coun-

            try joining at Rajpath, Delhi, to witness the grandiose events. The

            exquisite and glorious parade showcases not just India’s military
            strength, but also its varied heritage. The events commence soon

            after the flag-hoisting ceremony led by the President. The nation’s

            martyrs are paid tribute, and the soldiers are awarded Param Vir

            Chakra, Ashok Chakra, and Vir Chakra for excellence in their

            service.



            This momentous day was commemorated at Kristu Jayanti Col-

            lege, Bangalore, with an assortment of events across all the various

            departments. The events organized strive to inculcate a sense of

            appreciation and pride for the Indian constitution in the minds of

            the students. The Department of Forensic Science, Kristu Jayanti

            College, organized an essay writing contest for all the students of

            the department to celebrate the eventful day. The brochure for the
            competition was shared with the students on 13 January 2023.

            Interested students were to register for the contest. The essays

            were to be handwritten in English with a word limit of 800-1500.

            The subject matter was “Constitutional Obligations”, which was

            shared along with the brochure.]]></page><page Index="8"><![CDATA[The contest was held on 25 January 2023 at 4:30 PM. The high-

            lights of the events are shared in the following sections.



            Alongside the commemorative event, this issue also houses an

            extensive range of themes relating to forensic science. The di-

            verse themes cover fundamental topics like toxicology, bal-

            listics, and forensic medicine to more progressive and riveting

            topics like DNA (Deoxyribonucleic acid) databases, cloud foren-

            sics, Interpol and metaverse, digital vehicle forensics, and even
            self-automated cars and their forensic challenges. The issue also

            accommodates an expert talk with Mr. P Suresh Kumar, honor-

            able judge of the POCSO (Protection of Children from Sexual

            Offences) special court in Kasargod, Kerala, where sir has elab-

            orated on questions pertaining to the Indian judiciary and do-

            mestic violence. On the whole, the issue covers a total of 1 ex-
            pert talk, 5 research articles, 3 global news updates relevant to

            the forensic field, 4 case studies, 9 feature articles, 3 literature

            reviews, and 2 statistical data articles. The exhaustive concepts

            covered in this comprehensive issue are far-reaching when con-

            cerned with the various domains dealt with in forensic science.

     GRAMME ON ‘EVOLVING RESEARCH



      PARADIGMS IN FORENSIC SCIENCE’



         The Faculty development programme (FDP) was organised between

         12-20 December 2022 over the Zoom platform. The faculty devel-

         opment programme was specifically crafted for the discipline of fo-

         rensic science and had various topics ranging through the different

         disciplines of forensic science. The FDP spanned 7 days and each day

         had two technical sessions. The FDP gathered a lot of interest from

         delegates from different parts of India from various academic insti-
         tutions. The FDP was conducted in the virtual mode over the Zoom

         platform.

         With 10 sessions, the FDP was rich in substance and diverse in vari-

         ety.

         Overall, there were 22 external delegates in the FDP from around 8

         different institutions spanning 7 different states of India.

         The first session was on ‘Paradigm shift in research in forensic sci-

         ence’ by Dr. Vina Vaswani, Professor at Yenepoya Medical College,

         Mangalore. Mam rightfully began the FDP by outlining the shift and

         the paradigm shift that we are witnessing in the field of forensic sci-

         ence research. She encouraged the audience to indulge in the field of

         research at a right time such as this. She also outlined the ethical and
         moral responsibilities to possess during research.

         Malaria Research. Sir with his rich experience outlined the need for
         ethical guidelines, the organisations involved in ethical guidelines,

         and outlined the steps a researcher needs to take in order to conduct

         fair and responsible research. He exhorted the audience to take these

         guidelines both seriously and rightly for being effective researchers

         of tomorrow.

         The Department of Forensic Science conducted an offline workshop

         on ‘Forensic Psychology’ on 24/09/2022 to provide hands-on and
         case study-based training on the field of forensic psychology to UG

         students of forensic science. The resource person for this workshop

         was Ms. Joulyn Kenny, Forensic Expert / Trainer, Mumbai.

         SESSION I: Ms. Joulyn Kenny, Forensic Expert / Trainer, Mumbai.
         The session on ‘Introduction, Roles & Responsibilities, Eyewitness

         identification & Testimony’ concentrated on basic features of the file
         forensic psychology. The resource person took the audience through a

         series of small activities that explain the difference between the field

         of psychology, psychiatry, criminal psychology, courtroom psychol-

         ogy, eye witness identification etc. She listed the branches and the

         unique features of each branch of forensic psychology. The exercises

         helped the students understand the differences in a stark manner. She

         also elaborated on the DNA Innocence project which led the move-
         ment against unjust criminalization of thousands and played a few

         clips from the series of events which led to the movement.

         SESSION II: Ms. Joulyn Kenny, Forensic Expert / Trainer, Mumbai.
         The session on ‘Forensic Psychology in Courtroom, Treatment & re-

         habilitation of offenders’ included case study based activity where

         multiple cases of similar nature were discussed and the students had
         to perform activities individually and give opinions on their findings

         and impressions. Multiple students took part actively and they could

         get to understand how the roles and responsibilities of a forensic psy-

         chologist must be properly understood in a compartmentalised fash-

         ion in order to be able to get the right conclusions. This exercise was
         made in a student-friendly fashion and helped students grasp the les-

         sons learnt in the first session in a first-hand manner.

          based’ has a group activity where an entire case file was distributed

          to each group. Students formed a total of 10 groups with 8 members

          in each group and got the same case file. Each group went through

          the case file and were asked to fill up a forensic psychology report in

          the given format. This activity tested their knowledge gained from

          previous two sessions and gave a group level understanding. They
          could speak and discuss among classmates and got to understand

          how interpretations and qualitative measures have to be in a graded

          and regulated manner. This helped understand how cases can be in-

          terpreted in multiple ways, but how the science behind each interpre-

          tation must remain the same. Students could understand the value of

          the basic components in the field of forensic psychology.

          Winning essay of the Essay competition on ‘Constitutional Obliga-

                        tions’ held to commemorate Republic day 2023.




         Constitutional obligations are the set of rules that all the citizens of

         India must abide by as the citizens and the fellow beings who enjoy
         the government facilities. Indian Constitution provides us with the

         freedom of religion, education, political and many more provisions

         under which we Indian or the citizens, government officials and the

         people reside here enjoy these, so we have that minimal sense of

         responsibility that we must follow in order to enjoy the ‘Republic

         -Democratic’ government of India.

         The Constitution under the chairmanship of Dr Rajendra Prasad in
         1946, was the first step towards the formation of the Constitution as-

         sembly. Dr BR Ambedkar, prominently known as the architect of In-

         dian constitution visited many countries and read many constitutions

         of other countries in order to bring the flexible and practicable laws

         for Indian Constitution.

         The Indian Constitution is known as the ‘Elephantine Constitution’
         due to its size which contains more than 4000 pages in it. It is the

         world’s largest hand-written constitution which was started in 1945

         December 9th and was completed on 26th January 1949. 11 sessions

         were held to discuss the Constitution that we hold and finally on 24th

         January 1950 our constitution was signed and 26th of January 1950

         our constitution was given/taken by our people of India. Initially our
         constitution consisted of 395 articles, 08 parts and 22 schedules. Now

         446 Articles,12 parts, 24 Schedules and 101 Amendments.

          of so many cases in the courts, and why do people take laws so

          lightly?
                    The main reason behind the huge pendency of cases in the

          courts in India is the huge disparity in the judge-citizen ratio. The

          number of judges is highly disproportionate to the population. The

          number of judges is 12 -13 per million population as against an

          estimated requirement of 50 judges per million population. The

          judge-population ratio in India is the lowest in the world. More-
          over, 25-30% of the posts out of the existing sanctioned strength of

          judges are normally lying vacant at any point in time. A judge in

          India handles 4 to 5 times more cases every day than the maximum

          a judge can normally handle a day. This results in liberal adjourn-

          ments and delays in the disposal.

          Another reason is that the institution of cases in the courts far ex-

          ceeds their disposal. More cases are filed every year than the num-
          ber of cases disposed of. This amounts to adding up more and more

          cases to the existing pendency. Even if the judges struggle hard to

          dispose of matters proportionate to the pendency, there would not

          be any result. The pendency will remain the same or even higher,

          depending on the number of institutions of cases.

          Yet another reason is the poor infrastructure of courts. The courts

          in India still lag in computerization and adapting information tech-
          nology.

          People take laws lightly not because the punishment for offences

          are inadequate. The people in India are very poor followers of our

          civic duties and have very poor civic sense. They are too reluctant

          to abide by laws, respect their fellow men, and maintain decorum in

          public places. This is the reason why people take laws so

          lightly.

          lence and mistreatment of women to be natural or as part of the

          society even if stringent laws have been imposed in the country?

                    The main reasons for domestic violence against women are

          the patriarchal mindset of people, lack of education, dowry sys-

          tem, traditional and cultural practices like Sati and Devadasi sys-

          tems which once existed, financial dependency, insensitivity of law

          enforcement agencies, etc. It is true that different communities in
          India, once and for long, had a notion that women were inferior to,

          and they should obey, men. But, at present, Indian society at large

          does not treat violence against women to be natural or part of the

          society. Still, there are men and certain communities and groups

          who retain the same patriarchal mindset and gender-based authori-
          ty and treat or believe men have the right to rule or overpower wom-

          en. It is a paradox that despite constitutional provisions and laws to

          protect women from gender discrimination and violence, the cases

          of gender discrimination and violence against women increase day

          by day. It is not the lack of law or punishment that matters, but the

          mindset of men, which could be changed only by education, sensi-

          tization, and spreading awareness.



          3. Is the Indian judiciary slow? In situations where other nations
          would have given stringent punishments, why is the Indian legal

          system taking too much time? Isn’t it a reason for people losing

          trust in it?

                    It is not correct to say that the Indian judiciary is slow in dis-

          posing of cases. The judges in India strive hard to expedite trials
          of each individual case, but the huge pendency of cases in courts

          makes their efforts insignificant. The reasons for piling up cases

          and delay in disposal have already been discussed in response to

          the first question. It is true that people will lose faith in the system

        INTRODUCTION
        As we are in the modern era, we use distinct products in our dai-

        ly life on various parts of the body. Due to the COVID (Coronavi-

        rus Disease) pandemic, we started using sanitizers on our hands, and

        the usage of various products such as lotion, creams and oils. Some

        of these products could affect or deteriorate or degrade the original

        fingerprints over time, and there is a probability of getting a chance

        print (oil, sanitizer, lotion applied print) that suspects may use these
        substances during their criminal conviction, making it difficult for the

        forensic expert to identify a criminal due to the product properties.

        Fingerprints are important and the best forms of physical and com-

        monly used forensic evidence over DNA (Deoxyribonucleic acid) pro-

        filing because of their uniqueness and are commonly used by forensic

        scientists as reliable evidence.



        AIM

        To develop the latent fingerprint stained by oil, lotion, and sanitizer at

        different intervals to identify the efficiency of the latent print.




        METHODOLOGY

        For this study, a control sweat print was taken both on porous and

        non-porous surfaces, followed by a sweat print after application of oil,
        lotion, and sanitiser each separately on both porous and non-porous

        surfaces.

          sanitizer, and lotion have the same effect on the paper surface on

          day 1 and day 7, as shown in the figure and the graphical represen-

          tation.

          On day 14, the lotion and oil print has the same visibility score val-
          ue, but here the sanitizer print has lesser quality than the other two

          products when it is placed on the paper surface.

          On day 21, two-thirds of the print is clearly visible other than the

          oil; the other two products have lesser quality than the oil on the

          paper surface.

          On day 28, all the prints have the same visibility score in which the

          print is less in quality, and thereby on paper surface, all the prints
          are deteriorating day by day. As this is a paper surface, the print is

          absorbed and degrading accordingly day by day.

          Because of the oil viscous nature and lotion non greasy nature and

          some properties in the sanitizer make the print deteriorate.




          DISCUSSION

          Despite the fact that fingerprints have been used as evidence in
          forensic science for over a century, advances in the field are still

          being made. Academic interest in assisting research should rise, as

          should progress in identifying exogenous elements that are usually

          found to be modified and used to perpetrate a crime and develop

          complete knowledge. The main aim of the study is to determine the

          effect of different daily-use products like sanitizer, lotion, and oil on

          fingerprint visibility and degradation over a period. The presence
          of oil, lotion, and hand sanitizer on the distal end of the phalanges

          affects the fingerprint quality on porous and non-porous surfaces.

          If the fingerprint pattern reveals clear ridge characteristics, minuti-

          ae, and pore details, precise identification of an individual can be

          made. If the features on the latent fingerprints are influenced by

          exogenous factors, the investigation will be halted due to a lack of

        mals. Hair is made of a tough protein called keratin. It mainly consists

        of two different parts that are the follicle and the shaft. Hair is also
        one of the most common biological evidence found at a crime scene,

        it is accounted as a class evidence. We can easily use hair to solve the

        question of who committed the crime as hair helps in individualising

        a person. From the root of the hair, we can get nuclear DNA (Deoxy-

        ribonucleic acid) and from the shaft of the hair, we can get mitochon-

        drial DNA. We can use hair to find out the race of an individual; fo-

        rensic officers differentiate between hair of caucasoids, mongoloids,
        and negroids, as all of these hairs exhibit particular microscopic char-

        acteristics that distinguish them from one another.




        METHODOLOGY

        In this study, the aim was to distinguish between the morphometric

        features of hair from the different regions of India. To do this, India
        was divided into six regions that included the North, South, West,

        East, Central, and Northeast. 300 hair samples were collected in total

          under the microscope for the medullary width, medullary index,

          hair diameter, and root diameter. The medullary width and hair di-

          ameter were examined from the proximal, distal, and intermediate

          region. This study was conducted as there is a lack of a database to
          identify people from different regions of India through hair.




          FINDINGS

          The data collected from analysing all the samples was compiled

          into a Google sheet, and the mean value of each of the parameters

          was calculated for each region, and the resulting values were com-

          pared with each other.

          It can be seen that the people in the North region have the largest

          root diameter and the people in the West region have the smallest

          root diameter.

         It can be inferred that due to a large number of samples requiring

         decolourisation in the South region, the hair of people in the South

         region contain more pigment compared to all the other regions. And

         in the West region, only 10 hair samples required decolourisation, so

         it can be inferred that the hair of the people belonging to that region

         have lesser pigmentation compared to the other regions.

          It can also be observed that the mean hair diameter value of North-

          east region is highest in proximal, intermediate, and distal regions

          compared to the other regions. And there is a significant difference

          in the value of the central region in the distal part compared to the

          other regions.

          hair root diameter for male population and the south region showed

          the lowest value of hair root diameter for the female population. It

          was observed that the average hair root diameter was higher in male

          population compared to that of the female population.



          CONCLUSION

          The major findings of the present study are:

          1) People in the north region have the largest root diameter and

          people in the west region have the smallest root diameter.

          2) A large number of samples required decolourisation in the south

          region, the hair of people in the south region contain more pigment
          compared to all other regions.




          It was also observed that there was a similar range between the hair

          root diameter of females of all the regions and males of all regions

          respectively. But since this is a study conducted with a small sam-

          ple size, this particular observation cannot be declared. This study

          is only a preliminary study and therefore can be expanded further
          with a larger sample size.

        INTRODUCTION

        Technologies are used to perpetrate crimes, and law enforcement in

        creasingly employs computer systems to fight crime because of the
        rising science of virtual proof forensics. The information recorded or

        transferred in digital shape that may be utilised in the courtroom is re-

        ferred to as virtual evidence. It may be located on a PC (Personal Com-

        puter), fixed disc, or a cellular cell phone. Digital crimes, or e-crimes,

        consisting of child pornography or credit card fraud, are often con-

        nected with virtual proof. Virtual proof, however, is being employed

        within the prosecution of all types of crimes, not solely for e-crimes.
        Suspects’ email or cell telephone documents may encompass important

        proof about their purpose, whereabouts at the time of the crime, and

        relationships with different suspects. For instance, in 2005, a floppy

        disk led the government to the BTK (Bind, Torture, Kill) serial assas-

        sin, who had prevented police arrest for the reason that 1974 and killed

        at least ten people. The medical gathering, evaluation, and renovation

        of statistics contained in electronic media that can be used as proof in
        a court of regulation are known as virtual forensics. Now police regu-

        lation enforcement groups are incorporating virtual forensics into their

        infrastructure to combat e-crime and acquire relevant virtual evidence

        for all offences.

        INTRODUCTION

        Poisoning is one of the most ancient crimes among humanity and

        one that will never fade in society. The intentions of poisoning range

        from accidental, homicidal, to suicidal. The choice of poisons also

        differ across intentions of poisoning. For example, a suicidal poison
        choice would be an easily available, yet effective poison, whereas an

        accidental or homicidal poison may go unnoticed (less effective) for

        many days. Traditional pesticides are the organophosphates, organo-

        chlorines, and carbamates that are commonly used in pest manage-

        ment in the agro-business. A new and emerging class of pesticides

        are the pyrethroids which are of interest in forensic science due to its

        undue use in poisoning - both with suicidal and homicidal intent.
        Pyrethroids are a synthetic version of pyrethrin, a naturally occurring

        pesticide found in chrysanthemum (flower). They were developed in

        such a way as to maximise their stability in the environment. It has in-

        secticidal properties of pyrethrin that are strongly lipophilic and rap-

        idly penetrate into insects, paralysing their nervous system.

        In this background, some facts about pyrethroids are presented below:

        Chemistry of pyrethroids -  Pyrethrins are a mixture of six structurally
        related insecticidal esters formed by a combination of two acids (chry-

        santhemic acid and pyrethric acid) and three alcohols (pyrethrolone,

        cinerolone, and jasmolone). The mode of action of pyrethroid poison-

        ing - They act as axonic excitotoxins, i.e., the toxic effects are medi-

        ated by preventing the closure of the voltage-gated sodium channels

        in the axonal membranes. When the toxin keeps the channels in their

          brane permanently depolarized and thus paralysing the organism.

          This present study attempts to understand the frequency and prev-

          alence of pyrethroid poisoning in India by understanding the pro-

          duction, sale, and number of poisoning cases reported during the
          period 2018-2021 in India.




          RESEARCH GAP

          A study to understand India-specific data with relation to produc-

          tion, sale, and poisoning occurring in India is missing. A study with

          such an objective can give a picture of the frequency and prevalence

          of pyrethroid poisoning in India.



          OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY

          The study was performed with the following objectives

          •  To estimate the production capacity of pyrethroids in India

          •  To identify the sales of pyrethroids in India

          •  To identify the number of poisoning cases involving pyrethroids

              in India
          •  To estimate the number of fatalities involving pyrethroids in

              India




          MATERIALS AND METHODS

          The study took place during the period 2018-2021. The study ad-

          opted a meta-analysis cum data acquisition process. The informa-

          tion on production & import of pyrethroid pesticides was collected
          from published online sources. The data was collected from a com-

          prehensive list of online portals that detail and list the production

          and import details of chemical pesticides in India. The details on

          sales of pyrethroid pesticides were collected from published online

          sources as well as information gathered from vendors. A compre-

          hensive list of online stores which deal with pesticide sale as well

          The details on fatalities by pyrethroid poisoning were collected from

          medical hospital records across India. Different databases were re-

          viewed, and written communications were employed to collect this

          information. For the last 2 parameters, the region-wise zone was

          tabulated for comparison to ensure easy understanding of the data.

          For the purposes of this study, India was split into 6 regions.



          FINDINGS AND ANALYSIS

          Production of pyrethroids in India

          •  Cypermethrin - The installed production capacity of cyperme-

              thrin across India was around 24 thousand metric tons in the fis-

              cal year 2021. Since 2009, the general public has not been able

              to access the chemical.
          •  Deltamethrin - Mostly imported. 20 thousand metric tons were

              imported in 2018. The data of import since then is not available.

          •  Fenvalerate - 200 metric tons (2019)

          •  Permethrin - 1000 kilograms per year (as in 2019)

          CONCLUSION AND FUTURE SCOPE

          The study shows a steady rise in the import, production, sales, and
          incidences of poisoning involving pyrethroid pesticides in India.

          The Covid pandemic served as a disruption to the study’s findings.

          Therefore, the trend of production, sale, poisoning, and fatalities is

          not clearly presented due to the disruption. But it is safe to say that

          overall, there seems to be an increasing dependence by the farm-

          ing community on pyrethroid pesticides. There is also an overall
          increase in poisoning and fatality cases involving pyrethroid pesti-

          cides in India.

          The thought that pyrethroid pesticides only cause environmental

          pollution is no more true if this trend continues. Pyrethroids have

                                                          67                        Veritas Volume: 2, Issue: 2]]></page><page Index="77"><![CDATA[been thought of as environmental poisons, more than animal and

          human poisons in the past. Many studies have an environmental

          concern in their objectives. This preliminary study shows the im-

          pact of pyrethroid use and abuse among humans in India.
          The trend is not clear due to the pandemic disruption in the period

          of study. But overall there seems to be an increase in the number of

          poisoning and fatalities of pyrethroids in India. This trend is indic-

          ative of the rise of pyrethroid pesticides as the new class of toxins

          - for both suicidal and homicidal purposes.

          This study can further be strengthened by taking into consideration

          the number of suicidal poisonings, homicidal poisonings, and ac-
          cidental poisonings. This can give an indication as to its abuse pat-

          tern. A more definite statistical study can provide insights as to

          whether the pattern is similar in other countries or if it is in India

          alone. This can give an indication of regional use/abuse.

        Usually, latent fingerprints are developed using the powder method on

        non-porous smooth surfaces. The powders employed are specific for

        certain surfaces and their color. Here I have used basic, easily avail-

        able powders and flours in a typical Indian household, these range from

        chilli powder to all-purpose flour. Conventional powders are hard to
        get and expensive and toxic when compared to the food powders that

        we use. The importance of such an alternative is when the convention-

        al is limited or not available.



































        THE PROCESS

        A total of 8 finely grounded powders and flours were used: Kashmi-

        ri Chili powder, Coriander powder, Pepper powder, Turmeric powder,

        Rice flour, Wheat flour, Corn flour, and All-purpose  flour. A blush

        brush and glassware were used for the development of latent print.

          The latent fingerprint developed using the above powders can be

          used for studying and comparison considering them to be a good

          alternative. The usage of coffee powder, fenugreek powder, tea, and

          asafoetida powder for latent print development gave negative re-

          sults. This experiment worked on the principle of the conventional

          powders, the mechanical adherence or adsorption of powder to the
          sweat residue. The development was not done in aged prints.

          “Succinctly put, a crime scene is like an archeology site. If an ex-

          cavation is botched or bulldozed away, there’s no going back.” says

          the American crime writer Patricia Cornwell. The quote rightly

          points to the importance of crime scene examination, timely col-

          lection of evidence, and the testing of this evidence. If evidence
          gets overlooked and the crime scene is wiped clean, the investigator

          or forensic expert would permanently lose out on crucial incrim-

          inatory evidence at the scene. Such scenarios highlight the need

          for state-of-the-art equipment to conduct crime scene searches, ev-

          idence detection, and documentation of evidence.

          The handheld device has an interface that requires minimum per-

          sonnel training for use. The device was introduced in 2021. Ocean
          county sheriff’s office in New Jersey (United States) and Glouces-

          tershire Constabulary (United Kingdom) are among the few offices

          utilising the equipment for better policing. The latter obtained the

          device for £22,000 through a bid. Owing to the futuristic and sci-fi-

          like technology, Crime-lite® AUTO also found its way to the popu-

          lar BBC show Silent Witness. The device helps reveal evidence like

          body fluids (including saliva, semen, blood, urine, and vaginal se-
          cretions), fingerprints, and trace evidence (including gunshot resi-

          due, glass shards, hair, and fibre). The equipment weighs around 1.6

          kilograms with the battery included. Crime-lite® AUTO is equally

          suited to the crime scene and laboratory.scene and laboratory.



          Foster+Freeman, being the leading

          Bloodstains are one of the most crucial forms of evidence in a fo-

          rensic examination. Examining the pattern and quantity of blood

          found at a crime scene could provide details on the nature of the

          crime. Its in-depth analysis can reveal absolute pieces of informa-

          tion such as the identification of a victim or the culprit responsible
          for the crime, the nature of the injury, the weapon used to inflict the

          injury, etc.

                 When entering a scene of the crime, the investigating officer

          must be able to detect and record their findings by means of sketch-

          ing, video, and photographing evidence. For evidence pertaining to

          bloodstains, the application of luminol and other blood detection

          techniques can be employed. Luminol is a widely used chemical for
          the detection of blood stains at a scene of crime. It basically reacts

          with the iron components of the blood and fluoresces when viewed

          in the dark. Apart from the dramatic flair it provides, it is accom-

          panied by a few setbacks. The technique improvised to counter the

          setbacks of luminol tests is ‘Steam Thermography’.

          and Stephen Morgan from the University of South Carolina, it is

          a technique that enhances the chemical contrast in thermographic

          images by exposing the said questioned surface containing blood to

          water vapour i.e., steam during imaging. This exposure generates
          heat, aiding the increase of the thermographic ally-measured tem-

          perature of the imaged surfaces. This can result in thermographic

          contrast between surfaces with different chemical properties. For

          blood stains, the enhancement capacity is measured by the radiant

          heat transfer which warms up the blood and its backdrop.




          REQUIREMENTS:
          The use of a portable steamer is advised along with the heat imag-

          ing IR-sensitive cameras. The thermal images are recorded through

          a sodium chloride salt window by a FLIR Systems A315 microbo-

          lometer-based camera (16-bit digitization, 240 x 320-pixel resolu-

          amounts of blood.

          The Calliphoridae family of insects, which is part of the Diptera or-

          der, includes blow flies (insects that have two wings). They belong

          to the genera Calliphora, Lucilia, and Chysomya. Despite being
          generally bigger than house flies, they have many of the same be-

          haviours. They are coloured green, blue, copper, and purple. Blow

          flies may also go by the names blue bottle, green bottle, or screw-

          worms. Warm, muggy weather is ideal for blowflies to flourish.

          side, they struggle. These circumstances are crucial to the blow

          fly’s life cycle.




          LIFE CYCLE OF A BLOWFLY!
          The female blow fly deposits eggs to start the life cycle. A single

          female is capable of depositing between 250 and 300 eggs, mainly

          throughout the winter. Two to three weeks are needed to complete

          the life cycle. The male blowfly is sexually mature when it is born,

          however, the female blowfly must ingest some protein before she

          may mate. The holes of a corpse or wounds are where the eggs are

          often placed. The rotting material is subsequently consumed by the
          larvae. The eggs subsequently hatch after 24 to 48 hours.




          FORENSIC SIGNIFICANCE IN REGARD TO BLOWFLIES

          Blow flies are indeed the organisms that first get attracted to the

          corpse. That is why they are considered to be of very great forensic

          significance. These flies are influenced by a wide range of factors

          that make them both, attract and repel. The legs, cerci, and anten-
          nae of blow flies have receptors that have the potential to respond

          to the attractants around them. They usually tend to prefer filthy

          areas and attract the odour of animal excretions and secretions, am-

          monia, and fatty acids. The fumes released by the burning of eu-

          calyptus oil in a simmering pot will repel these flies away. They

          have a tendency to fly almost up to 10 to 12 miles away from their

          origin by carrying traces of decay and searching for an appropriate
          dead corpse to lay their eggs whose life cycle is very significant in

          determining the time since the death of the body. Not just on dead

          bodies, rather they also lay eggs on meat, garbage, poorly managed

          compost files, and other unhygienic areas. They are not capable of

          harming you through a bite or a sting. But, yet they are way too dan-

          gerous as they act as vectors and may cause health-related diseases

           flies are found almost everywhere and are richly found in temper-

           ate or tropical areas where they can thrive. During the fall, there

           are chances of these flies entering our houses so as to find a warm

           place. This is to support their lives in the winter. And in the spring,
           they come into play thereby appearing in the houses.




           HOW ARE THEY USEFUL IN DETECTING CHEMICALS

           AND OTHER POLLUTANTS IN THE ENVIRONMENT?

           Throughout the generations, different wars have taken place be-

           tween various countries and regions. The use of weapons, espe-

           cially chemical weapons, was rampant during war times. These
           chemical pollutants remain in the environment and affect human

           health. In a study conducted at Indiana University, blowflies can be

           used to detect various chemical pollutants present in the environ-

           ment. This study has been published in a journal titled ‘Environ-

           mental Science and Technology’.

           According to Christina Picard, Associate professor of biology at

           Indiana University, “There are always blowflies about, and they
           are excellent at sampling our surroundings. They will taste the en-

           vironment as they fly through it, and their stomachs will preserve

           the knowledge. To ascertain which substances were present in the

           blowflies’ stomachs, researchers employed a mass spectrometer.

           Simulants of chemical warfare agents as well as some of the by-

           products that chemical agents break down into when exposed to

           the environment were both detectable. We would discover it on the
           fly if it came across a water source with a chemical agent hydro-

           lyzed in the water.”

           The researchers discovered that while chemical warfare weapons

           do not last for very long in the environment, they are sufficiently

                                                               Ms. Ananya Keshav



          Shraddha Walker, a 27-year-old woman, was strangled and chopped

          brutally by her live-in partner, Aftab Poonawalla, and was thrown
          off into the Mehrauli jungle in the national capital, Delhi. He killed

          her on May 18, 2022, and the case came to public attention on No-

          vember 11.

          Aftab and Shraddha met each other on a dating app called Bumble;

          both of them are from Maharashtra, and after getting into a rela-

          tionship, they shifted to Delhi in 2022. Shraddha’s parents were

          against this relationship between Shraddha and Aftab since both of
          them belonged to different religions. Shraddha and Aftab had a tox-

          ic relationship from the start, and he used to physically abuse her.

          Shraddha wanted to leave Aftab but was not able to do so. On May

          18th they shifted into the rented apartment in Mehrauli, and three

          days later, she was killed. Shraddha’s friend noticed her missing

          due to the lack of contact and informed her father. Her father filed

          a missing person complaint on October 6th.
          The police launched an inquiry into her live-in partner Aftab, and

          he claimed that Shraddha had left the house after an argument in

          May. He was still using Shraddha’s Instagram handle even after

          her death, and he was also active on other dating apps. There is

          also a record of transferring money from Shraddha’s account to

          Aftab’s. On November 8th, following further investigation, Aftab
          allegedly broke down and confessed.

          Aftab revealed that he strangled her to death and then chopped her

          into 35 pieces and kept it in polyethylene bags. He bought a 300-li-

          tre fridge to store her body parts and disposed of them in the Meh-
          rauli forest in several days. While analysing his transaction details,

          it was seen that he spent a lot of money to buy room fresheners and

          incense sticks to mask the stench of the rotting body. Aftab told

          the police that he was a trained chef and disposed of her liver and

          intestine by mincing them.

          The blood samples obtained from Aftab’s kitchen have been sent

          to the forensic lab for examination and have been confirmed to

          belong to Shraddha. The DNA (Deoxyribonucleic acid) sample

          of Shraddha’s father was taken for reference. Police are searching

          for CCTV (Closed-Circuit Television) footage in order to check

          whether Aftab received any help from outside and to corroborate

          his statements. Shraddha’s phone, her skull, and the murder weap-
          on are yet to be found. Forensic analysis of the bones found so

          far revealed that they belonged to Shraddha. The clothes worn by

          Shraddha and Aftab were thrown in the civil garbage and are yet

          to be found. The forensic science laboratory in Rohini submitted

          Aftab’s narco-analysis test report where he confessed that it was a

          pre-planned murder. The autopsy report reveals that she was dis-

          membered using a saw.
          Even though the case is only 80% complete to date, justice should

          be served to Shraddha Walker. According to the reports, Aftab is

          lodged at Tihar jail number 4 and is kept in a separate cell for se-

          curity reasons which will be monitored 24 hours through CCTV

          cameras.

          A case that shocked the conscience of the world was brought to

          light when Elisabeth Fritzl was able to escape from her captor, her
          father, in April 2008. This is a story of 24 years of cruel, inhuman,

          and sadistic exploitation which began when she was barely 11 years

          old.

          Elisabeth Fritzl lived with her parents Josef Fritzl and Rosemarie

          Fritzl and her siblings. In 1977, when she was just 11, her family

          and siblings had gone to Italy for vacation with their family friends.

          Josef was alone at home with Elisabeth at the time and this was
          when he first raped her.

          On August 28, 1984, Josef strategically brought her down to a base-

          ment he had modelled and designed in their home, which was kept

          hidden behind a hinged door. Soon after fixing it, he pushed Elis-

          abeth inside after making her unconscious with an ether-soaked
          towel.

          When Elisabeth went missing, Rosemarie and Josef filed a miss-

          ing report. While the investigations were going on, Josef claimed

          to remember her talking about joining some religious cult. When

          there was no evidence of her disappearance, the case went cold and

          police stopped further investigations due to a lack of any leads.

          dark basement room with just the basic amenities which were re-

          quired. The continued violent sexual abuse led to Elisabeth having

          to conceive his child but 10 weeks later she had a miscarriage.

          After two years she became pregnant and gave birth to Kerstin.

          And later, her second child Stefan. Over the years, she birthed sev-

          en children in total. One baby died merely a few days after birth,

          and three were sent upstairs to Josef. The other three children lived
          underground with Elisabeth and never saw the outside world until

          their rescue in 2008.

          Josef claimed he found notes with babies found at the doorstep or

          hidden among bushes that these kids belonged to Elisabeth and that

          she was sending her children to her parents to take adequate care of

          them as she couldn’t give.

          The cell never got hot water neither a heating system nor air circu-
          lation. Yet, Elisabeth tried giving her children the most normal life

          she could and even taught them how much she knew in the dark

          basement.

          The children grew up in unhealthy conditions and had to witness

          terrors from a young age as Josef raped their mother in front of

          them. This led to lasting physical and psychological damage in all

          of them.

          casionally heard, but he excused them as damaged pipelines and

          noisy heaters, those were the miserable yelps of Elisabeth.

          In 2008, Kerstin, the eldest child who was 19 years old by then, fell

          severely ill. Elisabeth begged her father to give medical attention to

          her sickly daughter. He had a change of mind and took her to the

          hospital where the horrifying truth of Elisabeth’s ordeal over the

          past years finally came to light.
          For a week, Kerstin was in the hospital and was being questioned

          by police regarding her family, but no one came to endorse her. She

          had bruises and a discoloured body, as Josef had physically abused

          her too and she’d never seen sunlight in her lifetime.

          Police got suspicious and questioned Josef regarding her sudden

          appearance. They reopened the case and went through the notes al-

          legedly sent by Elisabeth and noticed an irregularity in them. Being
          pressured by police, Josef finally released Elisabeth from her cell

          on 26 April 2008, 24 years after her imprisonment.

          Elisabeth rushed to the hospital Kerstin was in. Her presence at the

          hospital startled the police. They interrogated her regarding what

          the truth was. Elisabeth made a deal with them first claiming to

          never come face to face with her father Josef ever again. After this,

          she revealed everything he had done to her in the last 24 years of
          her captivity.

          The police filed charges of rape, manslaughter, false imprisonment,

          and incest based on the evidence provided by Elisabeth. Her fami-

          ly was questioned subsequently but everyone claimed to not know

          anything.

          Josef showed up at the court covering his face for the first two days.
          He claimed to be not guilty. As the case went on, he was charged

          with murder and rape. Ultimately, Josef suddenly changed his claims

          and admitted to his guilt.

          When the details of this sordid case came to light years later, the

          rest of the family was horrified to know what had occurred beneath

          the roof of their home. Josef went on to mastermind a plan to keep

          his daughter under his custody for 24 years.
          In Austria, judgement is not based on all the claims collectively but

          on the highest punishment. Hence, he was sentenced to life impris-

          onment for captivating his daughter and using her as a sex slave for

          24 years.

          Now Elisabeth and her children live in a designated location with

          full police protection and new identities. This case horrified the

          authorities and the rest of the world.

          INTRODUCTION

          Dennis Andrew Nilsen aka The Kindly Killer was a serial killer,

          necrophile, and an ephebophile who was active in London between
          1978 and 1983. He was also known as The British Jeffrey Dahmer

          because of the similarities in their victimology and modus operan-

          di.




          BACKGROUND

          Dennis Nilsen was born on November 23, 1945, in Fraserburgh,

          Scotland. He had a somewhat difficult childhood. His parents had a
          troubled marriage and divorced in 1948. As a result, their grandfa-

          ther took care of the children. As a young child, Nilsen was close to

          his grandfather who unfortunately died of a heart attack. The loss

          of his grandfather, and seeing the body before burial, had an effect

          on Nilsen’s personality. He became quiet and reserved.

          During puberty, Nilsen realised that he was homosexual, but he

          was unsure if he was gay or bisexual, because the boys he was at-
          tracted to looked suspiciously like his sister. Nilsen was bullied by

          his brother.

          At 14, he joined the Army Cadet Force. In Osnabruck, West Ger-

          many, he drank high quantities of alcohol to reduce his shyness and
          socialise. One time, he passed out and woke up at the apartment of

          a German friend. Though there was no sexual activity, this incident

          became a source of Nilsen’s fantasy about the sex. His fantasies

          became unambiguously necrophilic after he discovered the paint-

          ing The Raft of the Medusa. He went back to Germany and hired

          a prostitute to have intercourse with a woman for the first time. He

          found it “overrated” and “depressing” and concluded that he was
          homosexual.

          His mother voiced concern about Nilsen’s lack of interest in female

          companionship and a few months later, Nilsen and his brother at-

          tended a group – watching a documentary on male homosexuality.

          When everyone spoke about this subject derisively, a fight broke

          out between Nilsen and his brother, as he defended gay rights. It

          concluded with his brother telling their mother about Nilsen’s ho-
          mosexuality.

          don, he began visiting gay pubs. Nilsen had several brief, sentimen-

          tal relationships that ended in failure and hence believed that he

          was unfit for long-time relationships.




          MURDER

          Dennis began to actively seek out sexual encounters but he felt lone-

          ly each time his partners left. So he decided to force men to stay by
          killing them. He found his victim’s dead naked bodies fascinating.

          His first victim was a 14-year-old boy whom he had met at the pub.

          The boy accompanied him to his apartment and promised to sup-

          ply alcohol for the night. Eventually, he fell asleep. Fearing that the

          young boy would leave him if he awoke, Nilsen strangled him with

          a necktie and drowned him in water. He then washed the boy’s body
          and took him to his bed, where he attempted a sex act and then fell

          asleep next to the corpse. Eventually, he hid the boy’s body under-

          neath the floorboard of his apartment. He would stay there for sev-

          eral months until Nilsen buried him in the backyard. Meanwhile,

          he continued to seek out new victims.

          Some of his victims were homeless or sex workers while the others
          were tourists who had visited the wrong bar. No matter who they

          were, Nilsen wanted to keep them with him forever.

          He had been hiding his corpses underneath the floorboard, how-

          ever, the smell eventually became too much to bear so he started

          burning and burying his victims in the garden. He often saved his

          victim’s skin and bones. He often dressed them up, took them to

          bed, watched TV, and performed sex acts with them.



          ARREST AND DEATH

          In 1981, his landlord decided to renovate his apartment and he

          moved to a new location. He didn’t have enough outdoor spaces to

          burn the body parts and hence he began flushing human remains

          ly, the other residents complained and called in the plumber.

          Upon investigation of the apartment building’s pipes, the human

          remains were easily tracked back to Nilsen’s apartment. When the

          police asked him where the rest of the body was, he calmly showed

          them the garbage bag of body parts he kept in his wardrobe. On fur-

          ther investigation, it was revealed that there were body parts stashed

          all over Nilsen’s apartment. Though he admitted to committing be-
          tween twelve and fifteen murders, he was formally charged with six

          counts of murders and two attempted murders.

          He was found guilty on all counts in 1983 and sentenced to life im-

          prisonment which he spent translating books to Braille.

          In 2018, Dennis Nilsen died in prison at the age of 72 after suffering

          a ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm. He spent his final moments
          laying in his own filth in his prison cell.

          WHAT IS A FINGERPRINT?

          A fingerprint is an impression left by the friction ridges of a human
          finger. Human fingerprints are detailed, nearly unique, difficult to

          alter, and durable over the life of an individual, making them suit-

          able as long-term markers of human identity. They may be em-

          ployed by police or other authorities to identify individuals who

          wish to conceal their identity or to identify people who are

          incapacitated or deceased and thus unable to identify themselves,

          The scientific study of fingerprint and palm patterning is referred to

          as “dermatoglyphics,” a term that was invented in the 1920s.

          There have been many classifications that were put forward by sci-

          entists on fingerprints. But in this case study it was Juan Vucetich
          and his famous Argentine classification which played a crucial role.




          JUAN VUCETICH AND THE ARGENTINE SYSTEM




          Juan Vucetich was born in Croatia and immigrated to Argentina in

          1882. Within four years, he was working at the Buenos Aires Po-

          lice Department, collecting arrest and crime statistics. Within a few
          more years, Vucetich became head of the Office of Identification.

          Concern regarding the mobility of criminals in and out of Argen-

          tina prompted him to search for a more effective method of identi-

          fication. His search ended when he read the French journal Revue

          Scientifique (1891) detailing Galton’s research into the scientific

          use of fingerprints as a means of individualization. After reading

          this article, he began his campaign to incorporate the use of finger-
          printing into the criminal justice system of Argentina. His campaign

          paid off, and that same year (1891), fingerprints replaced Bertil-

          lonage at the Office of Identification. This was the first occurrence

          of fingerprint individualization officially usurping anthropometry.




          Working from Galton’s overly general three-pattern classification

          system, he quickly created a classification.



          The classification consisted of four single letters, representing the

          pattern on the thumb, and four single numbers, representing the

          patterns on the remaining fingers. Vucetich’s system started with

          the right-hand thumb and ended with the left little finger.

          left thumb (called the subclassification) and the remaining left-hand

          fingers (called the subdivision) represented the section.

          The secondary classification further subdivided the fingerprints into
          five subtypes: 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9. Each number represented a further

          description of the pattern, applied to either hand, and was placed as a

          superscript in parentheses. When the pattern type was a normal loop

          variety, the superscript defaulted to ridge count values.

          The first case in the world in which fingerprints were used to identify a

          murderer occurred in the coastal town of Necochea in Argentina on 29

          June 1892. It was actually a double murder, of the two young children
          of Francisca Rojas who had been found killed in their beds. Unfortu-

          The two children (either two boys, or a boy and a girl, named Pon-

          ciano and Feliza aged 6 and 4) were killed in their home, possibly

          by blunt force trauma or having their throats cut.

          It was said that Rojas was either unmarried or separated from her

          husband whose surname may have been de Caraballo, as she is
          sometimes called Francisca Rojas de Caraballo. She either found

          the children, or was found with them with a superficial cut to her

          own neck and she quickly blamed a local man, Pedro Velasquez,

          who she said had killed her offspring either because she rejected his

          advances, or because she prevented him from taking the children to

          give to their father.
          He was arrested and interrogated and some secondary sources even

          claim he was locked in a room overnight with the children’s bodies

          to try to force a confession, but he refused to budge. Furthermore,

          it soon emerged that he had an alibi. Progress was only made in the

          case when an outside detective was brought in.

          This was either a Croatian immigrant named Juan Vucetich, who
          was then pioneering the use of fingerprints for identification, or

          one of his associates named Edward Alvarez. When the new detec-

          tive went to look at the murder scene, despite it being several days

          old, he noticed a bloody fingerprint on the doorway of the room in

          which the children had been found. This double child murder now

          took a shocking twist. He had the piece of wood cut out and the

          fingerprint examined and when it was compared to the prints of the
          children’s mother (who said that she had not touched the bodies

          and so couldn’t have had their blood on her), it was a match.

          When confronted with the evidence, Francisca broke down and ad-

          mitted that she had killed her own children and faked her injuries

          because her lover did not want to marry a woman who already had

          children (this is another reason I think she was unmarried, or sepa-

          rated, despite what some of the secondary sources claim).

       and in 1905, the United Kingdom used this new technique in a case

       known as the Mask Murders.

       INTRODUCTION
       Occupational toxicology is the study of adverse effects of chemical or phys-

       ical agents that are encountered in the course of employment at particular

       workplaces. Occupational toxicology is a class term used to refer to the ap-
       plication of toxicology in all fields of work, ranging from a simple photocopy

       machine in an office to pesticides in agriculture. The range of hazards in cer-

       tain occupations is exposed to employees through mediums of inhalation,
       dermal exposure, or even ingestion. Toxicology is intertwined with making

       decisions on what levels of chemical exposure are acceptable to humans

       on the field. The goal of occupational toxicology is to protect the health of
       workers. The ever-growing recognition of workplace exposure has increased

       public awareness of the health effects of toxic workplace exposure.

       BRIEF ON INTERFACING FIELDS
       Various other fields work hand-in-hand with occupational toxicology. Fields

       like occupational health, medicine, and epidemiology interface with this

       field to derive solutions to the multiple issues faced by workers.
       •  Occupational health is a field of public health that deals with promot-

          ing and maintaining the highest degree of physical, mental, and social

          well-being of workers in all occupations.

       •  Occupational medicine is a subject whose core revolves around the

          prevention, diagnosis, and management of occupational diseases.

          Such specific medical examinations involve pre-exposure examina-
          tions and periodic examinations of workers.

       •  •  Lead Poisoning:
       The heavy metal is absorbed primarily through the respiratory and gas-
       trointestinal systems and negligibly through cutaneous exposure. The
       respiratory  pathway  primarily  depends  on  particle  size,  allowing  30-
       40% of inhaled lead into the bloodstream, whereas gastrointestinal ab-
       sorption allows about 10-15% of ingested lead into the bloodstream.
       General signs and symptoms can range from irritability, headaches, and

       vomiting to coma, seizures, and motor neuropathy.

       The ulceration of skin due to contact with hexavalent chromium was de-
       scribed by Cummings as early as 1827. This disease is common among
       workers processing chrome ore, chromic acid, potassium, sodium, and
       ammonium bichromate. Acute poisoning takes place through the oral

       route, whereas chronic exposure is via inhalation or dermal contact.

       Chronic poisoning can lead to diseases ranging from eczematous der-

       matitis with edema to deep-seated ulcers [in areas having a break in the

       epidermis].

       Asbestosis is a type of interstitial pulmonary fibrosis. It is caused by the
       inhalation of asbestos fibres over a long period of time. It develops as
       scarring takes place in your lung tissue, restricting breathing and reduc-

       ing oxygen levels in the bloodstream.

       an endotoxin from the cell wall of bacteria within textile fibres contrib-

       utes to the symptoms. Symptoms manifest in the form of frequent cough

       and wheezing within a few hours of exposure.

       jor risks are also a result of unsafe and unregulated proceedings in a
       workplace, especially in workplaces relying on the hard-working lower
       class.
       These examples cite some of the 29 ‘notable’ diseases and risks of oc-
       cupational exposures, therefore deeming this specialised field extremely
       important. A vast percentage of the Indian population relies on labour
       work in various fields to provide for and survive. The health and safety
       of these workers have a positive impact on productivity and social de-

       velopment. The Indian law has many provisions for the specific work-

       ing-class prone to frequent exposures to harmful toxins because the field

       of toxicology was used to determine the causation of deterioration of

       the workforce. In conclusion, occupational toxicology is a field that will

       help prevent irreparable damage and sustain the national economy.

       We, humans, have been constantly evolving with the help of technology.

       In the current era of digitalisation, this process is taking place at a rapid

       rate. There are multiple innovations taking place in all fields, including
       the medical and pharmaceutical industries, banking sectors, and auto-

       mobile industries. One such innovation of the automobile industry is

       Self-Automated Vehicles (SAVs) which is witnessing constant upgrada-

       tion with the improvement of technology.

       An autonomous car is a vehicle capable of sensing its environment and

       operating without human involvement. A human passenger is not re-
       quired to take control of the vehicle at any time, nor is a human passen-

       erything that an experienced human driver does.



       The Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) currently defines 6 levels

       of driving automation ranging from Level 0 (fully manual) to Level 5

       (fully autonomous). These are:

       •  NO AUTOMATION: The human performs all driving tasks (steering,

          acceleration, braking, etc.).

       •  DRIVER ASSISTANCE: The vehicle features a single automated
          system (e.g., it monitors speed through cruise control).

       •  PARTIAL  AUTOMATION: The  vehicle can  perform steering and

          acceleration. The human still monitors all tasks and can take control

          at any time.

       •  CONDITIONAL AUTOMATION: Environmental detection capabil-

          ities. The vehicle can perform most driving tasks, but human override

          is still required.
       •  HIGH AUTOMATION: The vehicle performs all driving tasks under

          specific circumstances. Human override is still an option.

       •  FULL AUTOMATION: The vehicle performs all driving tasks under

          all conditions. Zero human attention or interaction is required.

       FORENSIC CHALLENGES

























         Fig 2. Image shows the various possible entities that could be liable when an
                                           accident occurs by an SAV




       AV forensics framework imposes several unique challenges for forensics

       investigation.  The significant challenges of AV forensics are:

       •  Huge amount of data: An AV generates a huge amount of data each
           day. In each second, radar and ultrasonic sensors generate 10-100 KB

           (Kilobyte), GPS (Global Positioning System) generates 50 KB, cam-

           eras generate 20-40 MB (Megabyte), and LiDAR generates 10-70 MB

           data. On average, an AV generates 4000 GB (Gigabyte) of data each

           day. Such massive amounts of sensor data impose challenges in AV

           forensics.

       •  Log accessibility: Proper access control of information and logs col-
           lected from AV is essential. The developers of AD (Autonomous Driv-

           ing) systems and the investigators should be able to access the low-lev-

           el information. However, any third-party malicious entity should not

                                                         113                         Veritas Volume: 2, Issue: 2]]></page><page Index="123"><![CDATA[be able to extract any meaningful data from the logs.

      •  Evidence Examination: An AD system may generate a considerable

         number of logs due to dynamic road scenarios. The investigator may

         face challenges in correlating the logs of different AD modules to

         extract crucial information as all the AD components work together.

         The investigator also must be able to construct the proof in front of
         the court.

      •  Evidence integrity: Current event data recorder systems installed in

         the AVs do not ensure the integrity of the collected data. A dishonest

         party can manipulate the data before presenting it as evidence. Hence,

         the integrity of the collected data is essential and challenging in AV

         forensics.



      CONCLUSION

      As technology expands throughout the world, self-driving cars will be-

      come the future mode of transportation universally. The legal, ethical,

      and social implications of self-driving cars surround the ideas of liabil-

      ity, responsibility, and efficiency. Autonomous vehicles will benefit the
      economy through fuel efficiency, the environment through reduced car-

      bon emissions, society through more togetherness, and the legal system

      through a simpler system. As technology advances, the security tech-

      nology regarding self-driving cars will also continue to grow to combat

      hackers, improve the accuracy of internal systems, and prevent accidents.

       Cloud Computing: It is the technology that provides a variety of on-de-
       mand computing services to users over the Internet. These services in-

       clude applications, databases, servers, networks, and more.




       Cloud forensics refers to investigations that focus primarily on crimes

       that occur in the cloud. This could include data breaches and identity

       theft. With cloud forensics in place, owners are protected, and evidence

       is better protected. When illegal or criminal activity occurs using the
       cloud as a medium, cloud forensics professionals use their skills and

       knowledge to identify the responsible individuals or groups. Cloud fo-

       rensics involves cloud users, both victims and perpetrators. For exam-

       ple, companies using cloud servers can become victims of data breaches

       and denial-of-service incidents. Criminals themselves can also use the

       cloud to launch attacks.



       Like other subfields of forensics, cloud forensic scientists must follow

       strict regulations in order for their work to be admissible in court. This

       may include obtaining court orders to search cloud servers, verifying

       that evidence has not been tampered with, and taking other necessary.

       Digital forensics is a branch of forensics that uses electronic devices and

       data to uncover crimes, trace criminal paths, and analyse and protect
       evidence for use by law enforcement and prosecutors.

       CHALLENGES OF CLOUD FORENSICS

       •  The storage system is no longer local and may violate jurisdictional

          law.

       •  Each cloud server contains files from many tenants.
       •  Even when data from a particular suspect is identified, it is difficult to

          distinguish it from his data from other tenants.

       •  Recovery of deleted data poses problems.

       •  There is usually no evidence outside of the cloud service provider that

          a particular file is linked to a particular suspect. In digital forensics,

          it is difficult to identify information, and if it cannot be identified, it
          is difficult to acquire it, and without acquisition, there is no analysis.

       Biometrics is one of the most interesting works or a way to solve crimes
       happening in day-to-day life. It’s a science based on the identification of
       a person by physical and behavioural attributions. The relation between
       forensics and biometrics is mainly concerned with the identification of

       a person based on characteristics that include voice recognition, facial

       recognition, fingerprint, iris, palm prints, ear prints, etc.

       Biometric systems make use of characteristics like fingerprint patterns,
       geometry of hands, iris and facial arrangement, voice prints, etc. Due

       to these advancements, biometrics is said to be a strong alternative for

       crime detection. It makes an endowment in crime detection by analysing

       traces of persons stored in databases, those which rank in identifying

       persons and result in comparison.

       HOW DOES BIOMETRICS WORK?
       Biometrics is a solely adopted automated system for identification pur-

       poses based on the physical and behavioural characteristics of a person.

       It extracts a salient feature set from the data and compares the acquired

       feature set from the crime scenes to the stored data set in databases. A

       biometric system includes analysis and verification steps.




       ANALYSIS: This includes the identification of a person by comparing
       AN   AL   Y  SIS:
       templates of individuals present in the databases; it conducts many ana-

       lysing steps to prove the identity of a person.

       TYPES OF BIOMETRICS
       T YP   E S OF BIOME           T R  IC  S
       •  FINGERPRINT BIOMETRICS: Fingerprints are the most important

          evidence that plays a crucial role in crime detection because of their

          robustness and uniqueness. Fingerprints are the patterns formed by

          the friction ridges on the fingertips. When a latent fingerprint is col-

          lected from the crime scene, these are scanned, and all the minutiae
          and patterns are noted down by the biometric system and compared

          with the information stored in the database.

       •  FACE BIOMETRICS: Face biometry-based identification is a tech-

          nology where a person is identified based on his/her facial character-

          istics. A picture or a video of a person is collected and matched with a

          stored copy in the database. The extracted features from this biomet-
          ric system are based on facial alignment, facial landmarks, etc. When

          they are compared with the biometric database, it gives the calculated

          similarity score.

       •  DNA BIOMETRICS: DNA, standing for deoxyribonucleic acid, is an

          organic biochemical compound that holds all the genetic information

          of a person. Due to its individuality and uniqueness, it plays an im-

          portant role in identification. DNA biometrics is done using the bio-

          logical samples left at the crime scene. The biological samples can be
          the hair strands of a person, saliva, semen, or anything else that holds

          biological information about a person. The usage of DNA for analysis

          is said to be DNA profiling in forensic science.

       •  PALMPRINT BIOMETRICS: Besides fingerprints, palm prints also
          play  an  important  role  in  forensics.  They  have  the  same  patterns,

          valleys, and ridges as on fingertips. They do play an important role

          in identification. The area of the palmar region is much higher and

       VOICE BIOMETRICS: Voice biometrics deals with the voice identifi-

       cation of a person because the voice is also a kind of trait available to a

       person. If the voice is the only available evidence found related to a sus-
       pect, then it is extracted from sources like gadgets (telephones, mobiles,

       etc), and it is compared with the available recordings or databases.

       IRIS BIOMETRICS: It is a kind of identification based on the patterns

       of the iris of an eye. The iris is an annular white region bounded by the

       pupil. So, when the suspect is under custody, his/her iris features are

       compared with the available iris databases, and the similarity score is

       calculated.

       Biometrics and forensic science make a good combination in crime de-

       tection. In spite of having similarities, they also have differences among

       them. They work on different approaches. Forensic science works after

       the event occurs, whereas biometric technology works before. The evi-
       dence found by forensics is unknown, but in biometrics, the information

       of the data is already known and needs to be verified.

       Digital Vehicle forensics is an upcoming field of forensics that deals with
       recovering digital evidence or data which is stored in a vehicle’s mod-
       ules, network, and messages sent across an operating system. In today’s
       world, almost everything is digitalized including vehicles and with this

       increasing digitalization, smart and driverless cars have become much

       more popular due to the advancement in technology.

       Nowadays, most cars have built-in GPS (Global Positioning System) or
       other features such as digital multimedia and/or internet connectivity.

       It also gives us a vast range of data such as favourite locations, home

       addresses, etc. and other personal data such as contact numbers, pic-

       tures, and SMS (Short Message Service) messages, and such informa-

       tion helps in forensic investigations since vehicle investigations mainly

       focus on the make and model of a particular vehicle.

       Berla is software that is used during the process of forensic investigation
       to read and understand the data vehicle stores. This software allows fo-

       rensic investigators to “identify, acquire, and analyse critical information

       stored within vehicle systems to uncover key evidence that determines

       what happened, where it occurred, and who was involved.”

       Berla is able to retrieve logs such as odometer readings, gear shifts, speed

       logs, ignition cycles, etc. which creates a timeline of an event before and
       immediately after an incident that can be used as evidence in a court of

       law.

       iVe is an ecosystem consisting of multiple tools to help investigate an en-

       tire vehicle with a mobile application to identify vehicles and a hardware

       kit to acquire systems and analyse data. As of August 22, 2022, version

       4.0 has been released, which is able to uncover more data and provide
       investigators with key information which can be used as evidence by ac-

       cessing the electronic control units of cars.

       they are compared with the biometric database, it gives the calculated

       similarity score.

      Asphyxia is a medical term used for death due to a lack of oxygen sup-

      ply to the lungs. In other words, it is a condition where oxygen is re-
      placed by other gases such as carbon monoxide, CO2 (Carbon dioxide),

      etc. Asphyxia is found in cases such as hanging, suffocation, strangula-

      tion, traumatic asphyxia, choking, gaggling, and drowning. The lack of

      oxygen partially is known as hypoxia and the complete lack of oxygen

      is known as anoxia these conditions can cause death. In a properly ven-

      tilated room, the oxygen concentration is 21%, when the oxygen level
      decreases to 10-15% a person’s motor function manifests. When the

      concentration reaches below 10% a person loses consciousness, where-

      as death usually occurs at a concentration level of less than 8%. The

      tolerance to asphyxia varies with an individual’s age, adaptation to the

      environment, and medical history. People having a history of cardio-

      vascular pulmonary or lung diseases are more vulnerable to dying soon
      compared to a normal healthy individual. The respiratory, vascular, and

      the nervous mechanism are affected mainly.

      1. Cyanosis: It is a condition in which a bluish coloration of the skin

      occurs due to poor circulation as a result of a lower concentration of

      oxygen in the blood. The colour change can be noticed within 24-48

      hours. The colour saturation will be high in regions that are rich in blood

      capillaries.

      2. Petechial haemorrhage: It is rupturing of the blood capillaries that

      results in a reddish rashes-like appearance.
      3. Cardiac dilation: Due to the unavailability of O2 (oxygen) tissues in

      the heart beings to stop functioning. The condition in which the left ven-

      tricle (main pumping chamber) is enlarged, affects the ability to pump

      resulting in heart failure.

      4. Fluidity in blood: Increased capillary permeability results from a
      combination of stasis and hypoxia. Stasis refers to the reduction in the

      viscosity of blood.  This results in fluidity in the blood.

       There are numerous methods and locations for recovering firearm evi-

       dence. Guns can be found at shooting sites by crime scene investigators

       and transported to the lab. Typically, following adequate documentation

       or photography, each bullet, bullet fragment, cartridge case, shotshell
       wadding, etc., is collected separately and submitted to the lab. Obtaining

       bullet evidence in an emergency hospital setting is another option. In

       these situations, the material should be identified as a biohazard before

       being delivered to the lab. Each lab has written guidelines pertaining to

       the packing of evidence and its submission.

       Bullets and slugs that miss their target sometimes embed themselves in

       surrounding materials, such as a wall or wood.
       The easiest way to collect this evidence is to carefully cut out a bit of the

       substrate and submit it to the lab so that a weapon examiner can careful-

       ly extract it. This stops incorporating or eradicating any indications that

       might be essential for locating and matching the allegedly used firearm.

       When packing a firearm, the firearm may be recovered in the following

       conditions:

       •  Condition 1: Hammer down, safety on, empty chamber, no magazine
          in the weapon.

       •  Condition 2: Empty chamber, loaded magazine, hammer down, safety

          on.

       •  Condition 3: A chambered round, a full magazine, hammer down,

          and safety on.

       •  Condition 4: A chambered round, a loaded magazine, a cocked ham-

          mer, and safety engaged.

       A bullet or a round leaves the muzzle of the rifle and descends the bar-

       rel. The barrel contains internal rifling. A gun’s barrel has set grooves

       and landmarks called rifling that force the bullet to spin when it leaves
       the barrel. The raised portion in the rifling is land markings, while the

       depressions are the grooves.

       Similar to imparting spin to a football, this spinning action makes the

       round move in the exact and extended course. In their rifles, various

       manufacturers use varying measurements and quantities of rifling. This

       enables forensic investigators in identifying particular gun makes and
       models.

       The round acquires distinctive striations or marks as it passes through

       this rifling. The different marks on the cartridge formed as it leaves the

       pistol function much like a fingerprint.

      utilise a substance called ballistic gelatin to ascertain the behaviour of a

      bullet being fired. Gelatin is a replica of human flesh that lacks any skel-

      Going back to the gun that was found around the crime scene, you use

      the recovered weapon to contrast projectiles discharged from it with those

      discovered at the crime scene. This procedure will either confirm or re-
      fute the validity of the handgun. Given that bullet B has five marks and

      bullet A has four, the gun that fired bullet B will not have been used in

      the crime scene where bullet A was found.

      When comparing firearms, cartridges are crucial pieces of evidence to

      take into account. A gun ejector or extractor marks as well as firing pin

      imprints can indicate whether it was the same weapon used in a crime

      The DNA (Deoxyribonucleic acid) database plays a major role in Forensic

      science and the legal judicial system. From not more than a decade ago fo-

      rensic scientists have been working tirelessly on making advances in DNA
      databases which is a dominant weapon used to solve crimes.

      DNA is the hereditary material in the human being which is individual
      for every human being. DNA evidence being the most popular evidence

      to be found on the crime scene, it has become a major concern to de-

      veloping a DNA database that assists the investigating team to solve

      the crime. Forensic DNA databases have become increasingly common

      since DNA evidence helped solve a double homicide in England in the

      middle of the 1960s. There have been triumphant narratives where DNA

      evidence did help solve crimes. For example, according to the

                                                         135

       tional Criminal Justice Reference Services (NCJRS) in 1999, in New

       York, authorities linked a man through DNA evidence to at least 22 sex-

       ual assaults and robberies that had terrorised the city.

       In 2002, authorities in Philadelphia Pennsylvania, and fort, Collins, Col-

       orado, used DNA evidence to link and solve a series of crimes (rapes
       and murders) perpetrated by the same individual.

       Once DNA is recovered from the scene of the crime it can be compared

       to the data available in the database or a sample of the suspect’s DNA

       can be compared to the evidence found at the crime scene. When a sus-

       pect has been identified, The comparison finding and then could be used
       to determine if the suspect committed the crime. Biological evidence

       from the crime scene can be studied and compared to the offender’s

       profiles in the DNA database to identify the culprit in situations where

       a suspect has not been identified.




       HOW EXACTLY IS THE DNA DATABASE CREATED?

       For illustration let us assume a man is found guilty of sexual assault, at
       the time of investigation and criminal proceedings he is asked to submit

       his DNA samples and the resulting DNA profile was added to the DNA

       database created. Similarly, another attack occurred a few years later and

       the sexual assault nurse examiner working with the victim managed to

       collect biological evidence. This data is then evaluated against the ex-

       isting data in the database. If in case the offender had committed crimes

       before this one, he will be captured, put on trial, and given a term for
       all the offences he has committed. In such situations, the DNA database

       helps in capturing the culprit in a very short amount of time and restrains

       his ability to engage in other illegal activities.

       DNA databases are typically used to correlate DNA evidence to the

       DNA of an offender’s profile. A system of national, state, and municipal

       established by the federal government in the late 1980s. “The Combined
       DNA Index System” (CODIS) is the system that stores DNA profiles

       collected through federal, state, and municipal systems in several data-

       bases that are accessible to law enforcement organisations all over the

       nation for use in conducting an investigation. The crime scene evidence

       can be compared to a database of  DNA profiles collected from convict-

       ed offenders by CODIS. To identify serial criminals, CODIS may also

       convert DNA evidence gathered from several crime scenes.
       Hence, it is observed that DNA databases will continue to be very ben-

       eficial for law enforcement agencies in the long run. It is recommended

       that a database should contain the most samples possible and be able to

       retain the biological sample for future DNA testing to get the most out

       of it.

       Have you ever thought about what comes into effect when a skull is ac-
       cidentally recovered from a nearby forest or a mass disaster? We know
       definitely what comes into play for the positive identification of the skull
       which remains unidentified. But what if traditional and conventional

       techniques of DNA (Deoxyribonucleic acid) analysis and dental record

       examination fails in that regard. In such scenarios, a methodological

       technique is being applied which constitutes a part of Forensic Anthro-
       pology and a part of Archaeology. Forensic Facial Reconstruction is a

       tool that is helpful in recognising the skull when problems like lack of

       information, cost management, and condition of the remains becomes

       an obstacle. Forensic Facial Reconstruction is a combination of artistic

       skills and scientific techniques. There is a controversy going on among

       the reviewers; some say this reconstruction method is just a technique

       of approximation that says a single skull can give different facial struc-
       tures while the others say that a single skull can give its only single form

       of facial construction. But as time passes with the advent of knowledge

       and technology scientific forms have evolved to make this method more

       powerful through means of 3D (Three-dimensional) techniques i.e.,

       what we call now as 3D forensic facial reconstruction.

       It is an alternative tool that plays a significant role when there is no or

       very little trace of evidence or its extract is being present for identifica-

       tion of the recovered skull. Now the question arises as to how to identify

       the victim when the only body part left is the skull which is already being

       destroyed or decayed by animals, insects, or any other environmental fac-
       tors. Earlier manual-based reconstruction techniques of the 2D (Two-di-

       mensional)-based mode used to be applied but now with the very fast

       pace of time, advancement has been done in this field to make the manu-

       al-based techniques more efficient and error-free. In the midst of the 21st

       century where every aspect has its technological dynamics, the Forensic

       Reconstruction technique is nowhere less. Many techniques and meth-

       ods have been introduced that keep aside the manual reconstruction, 2D
       drawings, and clay model techniques and relies upon the computerised

       3D techniques for a positive identification of the skull.




       Methods of 3D Forensic Facial Reconstruction: The methods include
       Me   thods of 3D F         or ensic F    acial R    ec  ons  t r uc t ion:
       both manual 3D construction as well as some computerised techniques.

       But both techniques need artistic skills as well as forensic aspects of

       Anthropology. The conventional techniques were based on clay models,
       wax, and plastic using depth of tissues. But now many software pro-

       grammes like CARES (Computer-Assisted Recovery Enhancement Sys-

       tem) and FACES (Forensic Anthropology Computer Enhancement Sys-

       tem) quickly produce 3D reconstructed images using scanned and stock

       photographs. The following methods have been used in the facial recog-

       nition:

       •  Anthropometrical American Method:
       This method is called the Tissue depth method. The method shares com-

       mon features like the 2D reconstruction of images. The method was de-

       veloped by Krogman in 1946. It involves techniques that require highly

       professional skills and training. So, it is not performed nowadays as man-


                                                         139                        Veritas Volume: 2, Issue: 2]]></page><page Index="149"><![CDATA[The method is based on the principle of measuring tissue depth using

       X-rays or needles and then recording.
       •  Anatomical Russian Method:

       This method was discovered in 1971 by Gerasimov. In this process, the

       total replacement of the classical use of tissue depth with facial mus-

       cle for measurement takes place. This method gives shape to muscles,

       glands, and cartilages by placing them in a layer-by-layer style. Recon-

       structing the fossilised skulls using this method can be done. But the
       drawback of this method is that it takes more time than the Anthropo-

       metrical method.

                                           the anatomical landmarks



       •  Combination Manchester Method:

       It is also known as the British method developed in 1977 by Neave. It

       is the most accepted method. Unlike the previous methods, this method

       takes into account measures of both soft tissue and facial muscles. The

       cranium and the mandible are articulated into the skull and then adjust-

       ed on a stand by placing them at 90 degrees on drilled holes. The depth

       is determined by age, gender, etc. The muscle is constructed by position
       based on the origin and insertion of the skull.

       •  Computerised 3D Forensic Facial Reconstruction:

       These are effective and the first computer-based method. They involve

       the use of 3D animation software that has sensible technology to model

       the face on the skull. Unlike the manual techniques, when the same input

       was given, it would always result in producing the same output. Further-
       more, it was possible to generate many faces with little variations from

       the same skull. Capturing of images is done by MRI (Magnetic Reso-

       nance Imaging) and CT (Computed Tomography) scanners, but recent

       pictures are taken by ultrasound that have the facility of giving an upright

       position.

        METAVERSE
        A three-dimensional virtual world is termed the next frontier of the

        internet. it could constitute a new world with limitless possibilities.  It

        is well defined as a world where people interact through an avatar to

        enjoy entertainment, make transactions, etc.




        FEATURES OF METAVERSE
        •  Persistent and massive

        The metaverse is not restricted by physical boundaries and continues

        indefinitely, feels real and serves as a global stage for interaction.

        •  Economy

        Individuals, owners, businesses can produce, sell their products which

        will be globally accepted by the others thus helping to monetize and

        allocate our financial resources.
        •  Digital and real

        It is an experience that spans both the digital and real world

       At  the  90th  Interpol  general  assembly  at  New  Delhi,  the  first  ever

       metaverse specifically designed for law enforcement was unveiled .It
       allowed the users to virtually tour the Interpol headquarters  located at

       Lyon, France without any geographical boundaries.




       THE NEED ONE ENTERING METAVERSE

       Interpol’s Global Crime Trend report listed money laundering, ran-

       somware, phishing, and online scams as serious threats and said that

       the crimes are increasingly moving online. Previously, concern about
       social engineering attacks, extremism, and misinformation spreading

       through metaverse social settings, potential crimes against children,

       financial crimes, cyberattacks, sexual assault, and harassment  were

       raised by the Interpol.

       •  Cases of assault

       •  Sexual violation of digital avatar
       •  Issues such as privacy protection, hate speech, polarisation, addic-

           tion, market gatekeeping etc continue to raise concerns

       •  Questions of control, content moderation, copyright infringement,

           political  destabilisation  etc  will assume greater  importance with

           growing metaverse

       •  Social inequalities, identity theft, psychological effects



       PRIMITIVE SOLUTION

       Interpol aims at deploying its metaverse technologies to remotely sen-

       sitise its affiliates and other police organisations around the world in

       this dynamic new virtual world.

       It has real-world benefits for the police including through better remote

       work, networking, modelling crime scenes to preserve evidence and

       delivering training.
       During a demo in New Delhi, experts delivered a training course on

       travel document verification and passenger screening in a metaverse

       classroom, with students then teleported to a virtual airport where they

       could put the new skills into direct practice at a virtual border point.




       INSUFFICIENT IMPLEMENTED MEASURES

       •  Meta has various functions to protect the safety of people in the vir-
           tual environment. For example, it has developed a “safe space” op-

           tion, called Personal Boundary, which imposes a distance between

           avatars of 1.2 metres; if this distance is exceeded, the platform stops

           the movement of the avatars.

       •  It is also possible to activate the recording of an event, which may

           persuade potential criminals, since they would know that their crimes

           would be recorded on video.
       •  The international police organisation has consolidated an alliance

           with the World Economic Forum, Microsoft, Meta and other com-


                                                          146                        Veritas Volume: 2, Issue: 2]]></page><page Index="156"><![CDATA[panies to carry out the initiative called Defining and Building the

       Metaverse which seeks to establish the “rules of the game” of this vir-

       tual universe: laws, standards, protocols and ways to investigate, prose-

       CONCLUSION

       It is expected that the growing number of active users in virtual envi-

       ronments will increase the number and type of crimes in these plat-

       forms. By 2026, it is expected that 25% of the population will spend

       at least one hour a day in the metaverse, making it increasingly urgent
       to design a regulatory framework to ensure the safety and integrity of

       people

       Veritas Volume: 2, Issue: 2, Pages:148-151                  Ms. Blessy John Kaalla



       Disasters are unpredictable; they can be natural, accidental, or man-

       made events that occur with or without a warning and cause or threaten

       to cause death, injury, or damage to property, the environment, or lives.
       Disaster Victim Identification is a process for recovering and identify-

       ing deceased people or human remains in mass casualty incidents. The

       establishment of the victim’s identity is critically necessary on human-

       itarian grounds for all the grieving relatives and legal issues to achieve

       closure.

       Identification is done by primary identifiers like comparative dental anal-

       ysis, fingerprint, and DNA (Deoxyribonucleic acid) analysis, or by sec-
       ondary identifiers like personal description, medical findings, records,

       clothing, and evidence found on the body.

       Body identification in fire disaster incidents becomes more difficult be-

       cause the bodies are in poor condition, being extremely charred and

       having only remnant burnt soft tissues and bones.

       in nucleated cells and codes for a protein called a gene and is located

       on each segment of a chromosome. The human genome contains poly-

       morphism in which the position of nucleotide sequences are different.

       It uses polymorphisms called short tandem repeats (STRs), which are

       regions of non-coding DNA that contain repeats of the same nucleotide
       sequence present at different genetic loci, for identification.

       In this study, Byramjee Jeejeebhoy Government Medical College and

       Sassoon General Hospital, Pune used DNA identification by polymerase

       chain reaction (PCR) technique involving STR analysis to identify 17

       charred burnt bodies from a tragic fire incident that occurred in a sani-

       tizer manufacturing factory.



       MATERIAL AND METHODS

       The autopsy included all 17 of the charred and completely burned bod-

       ies, it was difficult to identify them using secondary identification tech-

       niques as the bodies were deformed.

       The complete autopsy was performed by labelling the bodies with se-

       rial numbers. The following bones were preserved and sent to regional
       forensic science laboratory:

       •  Piece of sternum - 09 cases

       •  Part of humerus bone - 02 cases

       •  Part of femur bone - 04 cases

       •  Part of tibia - 01 cases

       •  Part of fibula - 02 cases

       •  Teeth - 08 cases



       Blood samples of next of kin were drawn for comparative DNA analy-

       sis. They were typed by PCR at 15 STR loci and one amelogenin locus

       distinct to each gender.

        On external examination, it was observed all bodies showed superfi-

        cial to deep burn injuries with charring, complete blackening, and heat

        ruptures exposing internal organs. Sex could be determined only of 4

        bodies, 2 males and 2 females.

        On internal examination, uterus and ovaries were observed in 14 cases

        and prostate in 2 cases with the help of which preliminary sex alloca-
        tion was done.

        DNA from bone and tooth was analysed at 15 autosomal STR mark-

        ers, D7S820, D19S433, CSF1PO, D13S317, D8S1179, VWA, TPOX,

        D3S1358, D19S43, D5S818, TH01, FGA, D16S539, D2S1338 and

        D18S51, which helped to establishing identity of 16 victims. X/Y spe-

        cific amelogenin gene markers were used for sex determination.



        DISCUSSION

        Meticulous planning and execution by police personnel and medical

        experts are required to establish identity in a mass casualty incident.

        In this study, the bodies were charred causing both autolytic and dele-

        terious changes, degrading the DNA. The advantage of using STR is it

        resolves the DNA fragment by polyacrylamide gel, differing by as little
        as one nucleotide in length allowing precise allele designation.

        PCR provides better sensitivity and specificity for phenotyping and ge-

        notyping techniques by enabling analysis of extensively degraded sam-

        ples.

        DNA samples are often extracted from the pulp tissue of the teeth (mo-

        lar and premolar) as they are resistant to microbial action, incineration,
        decomposition and weather changes. They are less likely to get con-

        taminated as they are protected by dentin-the hardest structure of the

        human body.

        In this study, it was seen both internal and external examination helped

        in sex determination but identifying the victim was not possible. Iden-

        tification of all the seventeen victims was done by performing DNA

        analysis by typing at 15 STR loci for each victim.

       DNA profiling serves as vital evidence enhancing the criminal justice

       system’s accuracy by identifying potential suspects, linking suspects

       to the crime, identification of the unidentified body or human remains,

       etc. It serves as the gold standard for individualising victims even when

       the body is highly fragmented, degraded, and extremely damaged, as in

       fire incidents.
       This study demonstrated the utility of PCR amplification of STR loci

       when involved in the investigation of mass casualties when reference

       DNA samples are available, providing rapid potential identification of

       human remains.

        Veritas Volume: 2, Issue: 2, Pages:152-154                   Ms. Sreelakshmi NM


       Strangulation is a form of death where constriction of the neck by a lig-

       ature or any material without suspension of the body.
       1. Ligature strangulation

       2. Manual strangulation by hands (throttling)

       3. Garrotting  (ligature strangulation by approaching the victim from be-

          hind)

       4. Mugging  (compression of neck by elbow, foot or wrist)

       5. Bansdola (compression of necks by using stick)

       6. Accidental strangulation



       Cause of death in strangulation:
       C ause of de     a t h in s t r an gula  t ion:
       Combination of asphyxia and venous congestion is the usual cause of

       death. Vagal shock may occur in case of manual strangulation. Cerebral

       ischemia and injury to cervical vertebrae is sometimes seen.




       POSTMORTEM FINDINGS
       •  External Findings

       Ligature mark is normally horizontal, situated below the thyroid carti-

       lage and encircles the neck completely and reaches the occipital region.

       Multiple ligature marks are suggestive of homicidal strangulation. If the

       victim is dragged by the ligature, the ligature mark may be oblique and

       upwards. Ligature marks may be faint or absent if soft fabric is used and

       released quickly after death. Fingertip bruises, nail scratches, abrasions
       over the neck indicate possibility for homicide. Presence of ligature ma-

       terial on the neck indicates strangulation. A transparent adhesive tape

       can be used to lift and collect the ligature material from the body.

       cates the victim had struggled to remove the ligature. Fingernail scrap-

       ings of the victim may show skin fragments and blood. In manual stran-

       gulation, multiple fingertip bruises may be present over the neck, along
       with the windpipe, depending on whether one or both hands are used

       by the assailant. Various sized contusions of fingertip around the neck

       muscles more towards the nape of neck are homicidal. If two sticks are

       used for strangulation, there will be horizontal marks on the front and

       nape of the neck. Severe internal damages or injuries are also scene in

       these cases.



       •  Internal Findings

       Neck structures are examined after the examination of the cranial and

       thoracic cavities. Laceration of the carotid artery and internal coats

       with extravasation of blood into their walls. Fracture of cornu of hyoid

       bones and superior cornu of thyroid cartilages is mostly observed in

       adults above 40 years of age. Frothy blood will be present in the upper

       respiratory tract and will be congested. The lungs will be congested
       with petechial and exude dark fluid blood is on the cut session. The

       right side of the neck will be filled with dark blood and the left side will

       be empty. The brain and the abdominal organs will be congested.

       Suicidal throttling is not possible as the victim cannot pressure himself

       for duration needed to cause death by compression of neck. A ligature
       tied around the neck and twisted by a stick below the mandible, may

       cause suicidal death by the ligature. In homicidal strangulation, the lig-

       ature may be tied with one turn and one or more knots may be present.

       When there are multiple turns present, each turn will be tighter than

       the previous one. Evidence of struggle, injuries, violence, intoxication

       or the hands and feet may be tied. Accidental strangulation may occur

       in case of the neck tie or dupatta caught inside a machine or vehicles.
       Tightening of the umbilical cord around the neck may cause death of

       infants in utero or childbirth stage.

       Criminology is the scientific study of crime and criminals and their
       motivations for criminal behaviour. Criminology is a branch of social
       science, traditionally examining human behaviour, communication, and
       organisation. However, it also connects research and theories from other

       fields of study, such as philosophy, anthropology, biology, and psychol-

       ogy. Crime experts explore a variety of topics related to crime. They are

       committed to studying not only the causes of crime but also the social

       background and impact. The ultimate goal of crime is to clarify the

       causes of criminal behaviour and to develop effective and humane ways

       to prevent it. These objectives have produced a number of schools of
       thought within discipline, each looking at the different aspects involved

       in misconduct and reaching different conclusions about how best to deal

       with problems.

       When it comes to the manner and extent of data collection differs con-

       siderably from country to country and also even within countries that

       have federal systems, it may vary accordingly. The variables include

       how often the data are collected and published, also it would  have  the
       date on what items are given importance, whether the choice is between

       complete listings or the surveys, and also on what the ratio between

       governmental and the private research are.

       These differences are combined with differences in law and legal sys-

       tem and administration also in the popular views and its habits have

       also made it difficult to devise a meaningful system of the international

       collected separately as well.

       One of the most common data used in criminological research are offi-

       cial statistics which are collected and analysed as part of the operation

       of criminal justice agencies or organisations. For example if a police
       collect the data on the crimes they know about and on the people they

       have arrested for committing those crimes, the courts collect the data

       on the cases that are brought to them and also on the outcomes of those

       cases, including prisons, jails and convictions as well.

       Modus operandi is a Latin word that describes the individual or group

       way of working, which makes a visible pattern. The word is used pri-

       marily when discussing criminal behaviour, but is not limited to this
       context. Modus operandi can also be defined as a specific operating

       system. Understanding Modus Operandi Different groups of people or

       communities often display patterns of thought or behavioural patterns

       that are specific to those cultures.

       The analysis of Modus Operandi is done using the crimes, taken place

       in the State of Karnataka and that has been Reported in Police Records.

       A set of fifty such cases were taken into consideration for the Research.
       All Fifty cases are taken from the official website of Indian Kanoon.

       These cases are referred to understand the methods of Operations and

       Summarise the case study.

       Later the study was done by tabulating the details such as year and

       As per the above percentage calculation knife is the most used weapon

       in theft crime and jewellery items are the most stolen property this se-

       quential year.

       From the analysis, we can find that during lockdown periods the num-

       ber of cases were lesser than that of the previous years.

       INTRODUCTION
       Handwriting is an acquired skill and a neuro-muscular process and it
       is unique to each individual. Handwriting involves 27 bones and 40

       muscles to work. To determine the proper writing speed, the slow speed

       is indicated by writing with heavy pen pressure, blunt starts, blunt ter-

       minals, and pen lifts. Whereas fast speed is indicated by well-defined

       rhythmic strokes and tapering terminals. Tremors, retouching, and pen
       pauses in the strokes all indicate slow speed.

       Questioned document examination (QDE) is a forensic science disci-

       pline that examines documents that may be contested in court. The pri-

       mary goal of the examination is to provide evidence about suspicious

       or questioned documents by employing a variety of scientific principles

       and methods. Document examination may include alterations, by, pa-

       per analysis, forgery, origin, determining authenticity, and other issues.
       Documents related to a criminal or civil case can provide a wealth of

       critical information.

       This study aims to describe the relation of speed, pressure and legibility

       as well as the impact of different pens used namely ball point pen, ink

       pen and gel pen.

       ME    T  HODOL         O  G  Y
       One hundred adults between the ages of 18-24 participated in the study.

       Subjects were told that samples were required of normal handwriting

       and they were unaware of the purpose of the study. The subjects were

       given three pens for this study: an ink pen, a ball point pen and a gel

       pen. To measure the pressure, carbon paper was provided. Writing pad,
       three distinctive pens and A4 sheets were used as writing instruments.

       To quantify the pressure, the indent writing must be visible on the next

       sheet. For all the four speeds, comparable arrangements were produced

       in collection. The subjects are instructed to pay close attention to the

       provided audio clip and compose the sentence while listening to the

       recorded audio because this can be used to determine handwriting
       speed. The speeds that are taken into account are slow speed, normal

       speed(which they usually write), speed and high speed. The ball point

       pen was solely used for the purpose of measuring pressure. The ink

       pen, ballpoint pen and gel pen were used to determine the legibility.

       Each pen was given three different sentences and also each of the given

       sentences had the words mixed or jumbled for each speed, so that the
       person does not foresee or think of the next word.

       The individuals were given A4 sheets with carbon paper sandwiched

       between them in order to gather samples containing pressure. The sen-

       tence given for each speed to check the pressure was fixed.

       Similarly, the sentences given to check the legibility of ink pen and gel

       pen also were fixed.

       CONCLUSION
       C  ON    CL   U  SION
       From this study it was observed that there is an influence of pen on

       handwriting which is aligned with the expected outcomes, that is as

       the speed increases the pressure decreases; as the speed increases the

       writing legibility may decrease and also give a positive effect of pen on
       different speeds.
